> Hello! My name is Von Taylor, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UC San Diego, and I am looking to gain real-world experience in the field through internships! I am passionate about programming, problem-solving, and overall learning new things! 
>
> I have experience in Java, Kotlin, Python, C, C++, and ARM Assembly programming languages, with Java being my current most comfortable language. I have an interest in databases, software development, application development, and I like to play video games a lot more than I should.

> Nice to meet you!
